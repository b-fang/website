_I followed along with MortDog's usual Post Mortem Analysis [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPbm52hzfrE). I wanted a 
place to both contextualize and branch off from, especially because I haven't had a lot of TFT experience since set 4.5._

## Purpose

- Show high level understanding of TFT mechanics relative to game design, outlining my thought processes
- Engage with the community to deepen my own understanding and help my own growth as a continue my journey to masters
- Stay up to date with TFT content and developer logs while also adding new insights.

> Author's Note: As of 10.18.22, I've actually reached Masters through mostly Jade + Whispers. In this post I go over how I felt like it 
was in a good spot, but considering how quickly I've climbed, I'd like to reevaluate my assessment. Jade 5 + Whispers is far too powerful 
given its flexibility, and luckily the patch 12.20 notes and nerfs seem to reflect the same opinion.

# TFT Patch 12.19 Impressions

As of October 15th, I have finally hit Diamond in TFT. To be honest, I still don't have a great read on the meta, nor do I think 
I am "good" at TFT, but I finally feel as though I have some ground to speak on the balance of current patch. Following 
along with MortDog's usual Post Mortem developer review, I thought I'd share some of my thoughts on the patch as an exercise 
in considering more these problems and solutions that riot developers face when trying to balance TFT.

## Shi-Oh-Yu + Sy'fen

The developer review started off by discussing the new comp that emerged with 12.19: Jade/Whispers with Shi-Oh-Yu and Sy'fen. 
From my own experience, I have found that this comp went along with a lot of what they had to say: You could easily stablize 
at lvl 7 and roll. I found that starting swords off first carousel just feels so comfortable and flexible, as there are many 
items that fit really well with the composition. Additionally, item components didn't feel super contested, which is extremely 
good in the cases that you are able to win streak early. For context, chain vest or negatron cloak are almost always available 
if you are last on carousel, which can become EoN, Titan's, or BT respectively. I feel that almost every item component is very 
strong with this composition except for rod, which is often rerollable with reforger or decent on a slot in Jayce/Soraka.

Overall, the ability for this composition to easily stablize with 1 stars at level 7 as well as no reliance of a 5 star dragon 
for a first place makes it a bit too powerful for a composition that can often first the lobby. 

## Front Line Karma Dragonmancer

Another Composition that MortDog quickly touched on, especially for being a lot of fun, was the front line Karma 3. I actually 
found this composition to be very balanced from my own play testing, and I enjoyed the difference in playstyle that it brings. 
I like how it is actually very difficult for this composition to become a first without 8 dragonmancers, which is already difficult 
to hit since you need at least 2 spatulas, which makes sense for a reroll comp that is strong during the middle stages. The 
inherit strength of a 3 start one cost should not carry over into stages 6/7, which has make me really like where this 
composition currently stands. I don't feel it is unfair to play against, and I don't feel it is weak either. Just a lot of fun!

## Astral Changes

The next subject that was touched upon was the Astral changes: tldr; more gold, less astral units. Although I did not personally 
get to really play astrals that much during 12.18, I do believe that this change has been good for the meta. The current state 
of 12.19 sees astrals a strong opener when you really just want to have a strong econ before transitioning into a new composition 
at 8, or sticking through it when you find asol. By curving 3 star astrals later into the game but instead providing gold, it 
takes away from the compositions strengths during the midgame, helping the early game become more dynamic and less afk (as mentioned 
in the rundown).

I don't have too much else to say without my own experience with the composition.

## Dragon 5 & 6

The changes to Dragon with the new health regeneration on 5 and ascendence on 6 both feel like great changes for me, although 
I haven't actually had an opportunity to hit 6. With regard to 5 dragons, in line with the developer experiences, I have 
found it to be a bit weak to burst, where you really don't see the health regeneration come in. Although it is certainly a 
step up from the old attack speed buff and does still put the focus on 4 dragons being the premier composition, I feel like 
these dragons should still see a bit of a bonus to resiliency when it comes to 5 dragons.

As for 6 dragons, although I personally have not been able to play the composition, I think it adds a lot of fun to the game 
where just its existence is exciting. Having the opportunity to transition into this composition when you high roll to that 
extent is a great option, and seeing clips from streamers of its potency is poggers! I'm sure it improves both the competitive 
and even more so the casual TFT experience. In the developer log, they did talk about how the composition did seem too powerful,
but considering my own frequency of expereincing it, and considering how you have to hit lvl 9 and be healthy enough at that 
point, it seems perhaps a bit overtuned but in a good spot. It was interesting to hear their justification for hiding the 
compositions exact benefits. Although I disagree a bit not giving players access to its exact benefits (like at least provide 
this not in game but in the patch notes), I think it achieved their goal of evoking player imagination and fun.

## Scalescorn Changes

The changes to scalescorn felt mostly unimpactful, albeit allowing for a bit more flexibility. The problem with scalescorn compositions 
was often the need for an early olaf, as well as good augments (for 6 scalescorn), making the scenario in which you choose to go 
scalescorn unchanged by patch 12.19. By adding dragons to the composition, you often still cannot properly fit the units that you would 
like to play. 

There are a lot of different trait synergies that you want to hit. MortDog specifically mentions 4 warrior, which must be forgone when 
adding whisper from Syfen (which is already extremely contested this patch) with a scalescorn emblem. Overall, the change feels mostly 
unimpactful, as well as a step away from the thematic elements of the set.

## Gnar and Zyra Changes

Gnar as a tier 2 champion certain feels a lot better this patch, where getting that 2 star version still feels powerful throughout the 
middle stages of the game. Personally, I've always seen 3 star Gnar as a massive bait, as his stats aren't too great (for the cost) 
and it is much better to just use him as an item holder until you can acquire Shi Oh Yu (2 star), fitting in 5 jade with Soraka instead. 

The Zyra nerfs are much appreaciated, as she has easily been one of the most toxic units throughout patch 12.18. The amount of CC she has 
makes swiftshots nearly unplayable, especially in the graves/seraphine composition where she benefits from Zeke's AS. 

## Nunu / Rakan / Seraphine Changes (Zeri?)

The Nunu nerfs really hit him like a truck, making 3 star Nunu no longer a win condition in dragonmancer compositions. In the podcast, 
MortDog goes over how this was probably hit too hard, but personally I disagree. The conditions in which this composition can just 1st a 
lobby was too high prior, but now it feels like a genuine top 4 composition, which I believe is a healthy spot for 3 star 3 cost units. 
8 dragonmancer can still see nunu as a side carry, but transitioning into a different unit like Dragonmancer Ao shin (when you do hit 
the necessary double spatula) can still net 1st place finishes. Nunu should really not be a unit that can just carry boards to 1st, 
and with the available flexibility in dragonmancer I think it makes these changes healthy for other carries.

The Rakan and Seraphine nerfs are mostly well appreaciated where the Rakan mana nerf makes him a bit less egregious to play against (when 
Rakan is strong he is just way too powerful), and the Seraphine meta certain has gone away. I do agree with Frodan on one point about the 
Seraphine changes, however, as there have been spots where the Graves Seraphine Composition just cannot power through Jade sustain even 
though the composition should theoretically counter it. This is both in part to this composition being too weak, as well as Jade just being 
in too powerful of a spot right now.

I personally have not been able to use Zeri too much, but the buffs seem appreciated. Can't really comment much further.

## Jayce Changes

> Skipping over Hecarim changes and other smaller updates since this post is getting a bit long. I'd prefer to just highlight what I think 
is important, rather than being an echo of the podcast.

The removal of Jayce CC actually completely went over my head without looking into the patch notes, as visually I still presumed that the 
ability had the effect. I think this actually speaks a lot towards the balance of Jayce, where it still seemed completely balanced from 
the way that fights were playing out even when you did not receive the knock up, but of course Frodan's point towards how the ability is 
a bit unsatisfying holds true. Additionally, I've actually felt Jayce to be quite underwhelming in the context of 5 Jade + 4 Whisper, 
where slotting in guild and shapeshifter is usually appreciated. Without items, Jayce just feels too weak, and often you'd already like to 
itemize Pantheon 3rd, leaving no room for Jayce items as well. 

## Item Changes

The nerf to Protector's Vow has finally come, halfing its shield effectiveness. This does a lot to prevent the insanity of Vow stacking 
that made boards nay unkillable, and puts the item in a good spot. I'm a fan of this change, especially after facing triple 
vow compositions.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, patch 12.19 has its good and bads. I've certainly felt the oppression of the Jade + Whipser composition as well as the fall 
out of Xayah and Guild + Graves/Seraphine, and I'm a bit unhappy with where the meta stands. Having a look at the prelease notes for 
patch 12.20, I'm hopeful that these issues will be addressed, especially with World's just around the corner.
