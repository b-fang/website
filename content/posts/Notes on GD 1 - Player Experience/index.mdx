## Purpose
 
 - Understand my own short comings in the context of building experiences for players
 - Reflect on how to overcome such challenges while redefining my perspectives as assets for my own target demographics

## Player Experience 

Recently, I've been following along with the 3rd edition of _The Art of Game Design_ (2019) by Jesse Schell. 
Since the content can be quite dense at times, I wanted to take an opportunity to reflect on notable chapters that 
deserve a second look, especially as I work hard on building a stronger understanding of game design. For this post, 
I wanted to focus particularly on the player experience, and how this concept pertains to different target audiences.

I want to reflect on my own strengths and weaknesses, and better understand how my own opinions and perspectives 
will correspond with particular traits in games that I value. I think it is important that I have recognize how those 
"shoes" fit me, especially if I want to be able to tailor fruitful experiences for others. This means understanding my 
own identity and demograhic as a gamer and gaging those community values.
